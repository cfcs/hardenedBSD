.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Fn pledge
function
reduces the set of operations the current thread is allow to perform.
The current pledge mask for a thread is copied on execve and thus inherited
to subsequent children, but it does NOT modify the pledge masks of children
existing prior to the call.
.\" this whole thing is a TODO
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Ex -std
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pledge
function
always returns:
.Bl -tag -width Er

The call was interrupted. TODO obv not

.Sh FUNCTIONS

.Ft int
.Fo pledge_string_to_bitmask
.Fa "const char *policy" "uint64_t *result_mask"
.Fc
Convert a string policy to a mask.
On success, the parsed mask is written to _result_mask.
Negations using a prefix of '!' is supported, and they take precedence
over the whitelisting flags.
